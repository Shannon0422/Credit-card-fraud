# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to learn about 
* Handling imbalance datasets
* Fraud Detection Models

This dataset is provided by the Machine Learning Group, containing 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. 
The dataset will not be included in this respiratory due to the large size of the file. The link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud will bring you to dataset in Kaggle.

At the end of this project, I hope that these models could contribute some insights to companies in modeling Credit Card Fraud.
